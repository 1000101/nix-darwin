- loeOf was removed from nixpkgs in 10881bbe11b2f66ebfa880795e5bc01a04158da4

    Using single items instead of a list no longer works for
    environment.systemPath and launchd.<serviceType>.<name>.path


2017-10-01
- added system.stateVersion option, add this to your configuration to
  avoid breaking changes.  This changelog and the activation checks
  will show instructions on what to do to safely increment this value.

2017-07-06
- added user channels to the default nix.nixPath

    Using a user channel now works without any custom configuration.
    See https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1548 if you are running into
    issues when updating your channel.

2017-07-28
- added support for command-not-found, using nix-index

    programs.nix-index.enable = true;

2017-07-23
- darwin entry in the default nix.nixPath was removed for
  system.stateVersion > 1

    Use a channel for nix-darwin or configure nix.nixPath

    sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz darwin
    sudo nix-channel --update

    nix.nixPath =
      [ "darwin=$HOME/.nix-defexpr/darwin"
        "darwin-config=$HOME/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix"
        "/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels"
      ];
